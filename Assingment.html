            <p>Nutrition plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, providing our bodies with the essential vitamins, minerals, 
                    and energy needed to function optimally. By including a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, 
                    we can support growth, repair tissues, and boost our immune system.</p>
